### Oh hi there!

My name is Neglexis, also known as one of the founders of Kayzr *(RIP BeSports 2016-2016)*.

We will be attending FoM as we have our own booth, but I'm **always** up for a programming challenge!

##### My skills include but are not limited to:
* PHP
* JavaScript
* CSS
* jQuery *(eww)*

##### Have worked with the following frameworks/technologies:
* Symfony
* Drupal
* Wordpress
* Kirby CMS
* Node.js
* Meteor
* React

I can go on and on, but I'd rather just show you a [picture of a kitten](http://huisdierencentrumhaarlem.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/animals-cat-kitten-cute-begging-kitten-wallpaper.jpg) asking you to pick Neglexis!
