ONE. Saphix here.

I'll be participating at FOM 19.0 and I'd like to participate to this challenge.

As lead developer for Sector One I should have sufficient knowledge for this compo.
I made numerous projects involving HTML, JS (jQuery, react, nodejs), CSS (and their precompilers) and I favor PHP in the backend.

See ya @ FOM
